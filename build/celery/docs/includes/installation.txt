Downloading and installing from source
--------------------------------------

Download the latest version of Celery from
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/celery/

You can install it by doing the following,::

    $ tar xvfz celery-0.0.0.tar.gz
    $ cd celery-0.0.0
    $ python setup.py build
    # python setup.py install

The last command must be executed as a privileged user if
you are not currently using a virtualenv.

.. _celery-installing-from-git:

Using the development version
-----------------------------

You can clone the repository by doing the following::

    $ git clone https://github.com/celery/celery
    $ cd celery
    $ python setup.py develop

The development version will usually also depend on the development
version of `kombu`_, the messaging framework Celery uses
to send and receive messages, so you should also install that from git::

    $ git clone https://github.com/celery/kombu
    $ cd kombu
    $ python setup.py develop
